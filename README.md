- Need `commitzen` to organize commit messages (You can have it globally by running `npm install commitizen -g`)
- Clone the repository and cd into repo `cd me-and-bro`
- To install all the dependencies of the project run `npm run install` (You need to have no errors till this point to proceed further)
